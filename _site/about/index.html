    <h1>About me</h1>

    <div class="about-page-section">
      <p>I create impact through leadership in technology organisations, focusing on effective execution and empowered people. I help individual contributors, managers, and leaders navigate growth and leadership challenges, and address organisational, operational, and alignment issues that slow down progress.</p>
      <p>Throughout my career, I’ve moved through different roles: from hands-on development to building and leading teams, and into strategic leadership. I’ve worked in product-technology organisations of different scales and stages, including leading teams through multiple organisational mergers. I've been accountable for delivery in environments shaped by growth, change, and competing priorities. These experiences shaped my approach to leadership, alignment, strategy and execution in practice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-page-section">
      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>I started my career with a background in computer science and years of hands-on engineering experience. I designed and developed robust software systems, including high-traffic and data-heavy applications, which gave me a strong foundation to lead in complex technical domains. With a solid understanding of architecture and technical trade-offs around scalability, performance, quality, and long-term maintainability, I’m able to create shared understanding and effective cross-functional collaboration.</p>
      <p>I later moved into engineering management, driven by a desire to help teams and people succeed. This experience gave me a good understanding of teams’ dynamics and the factors that stand in the way of high performance. I worked on creating environments and processes that promote efficiency and empowerment, and developed competence frameworks and growth plans to help people realise their potential and make informed career decisions.</p>
      <p>In later roles, leading platform teams and working at the leadership level, my focus expanded to strategic alignment, execution at scale, and organisational design. I worked on setting clear engineering priorities aligned with company direction, driving complex cross-team technical initiatives, and contributing to the design of effective processes and a well-functioning organisation.</p>
      <p>Alongside my professional work, I’ve consistently invested in understanding human behaviour, leadership, and communication. Experiences such as improvisation courses and Toastmasters International strengthened my leadership and communication skills, and have proven valuable in both personal and professional contexts.</p>
      <p><b>Main areas of my focus:</b>
        <li>Growing people and helping them reach their potential</li>
        <li>Building effective, high-performing development teams</li>
        <li>Designing organisations and operating models that support execution at scale</li>
        <li>Creating clarity and strategic alignment around meaningful outcomes</li>
      </p>

      <h2>My Leadership Philosophy</h2>
      <p><b>Empowered people in effective organisations create impact. Creating environments where individuals and organisations perform at their best is my role as a leader.</b></p>
      <p>Clarity is a force multiplier. When people understand the direction, the reasoning behind it, and are aligned on the course of action, their efforts compound. Leadership scales by empowering people with context and guidance to make the right decisions. Tight control creates bottlenecks; lack of context leads to confusion and stalls progress.</p>
      <p>Accountability is the guardrail of empowerment. Leaders are responsible for defining clear expectations and holding themselves and others accountable. I encourage ownership and initiative while setting high standards for myself and for others. Freedom without accountability leads to chaos.</p>
      <p>The best solutions emerge from constructive confrontation. I cultivate a culture where people challenge ideas openly, regardless of title, and do so with respect, focusing on shared goals and facts rather than ego or blame. Continuous agreement or silence is often a sign of missing trust.</p>
      <p>Efficiency matters. The optimal amount of structure and process supports momentum; too much or too little slows things down. Leaders create environments where processes and structures are purposeful and serve progress.</p>
      <p>Growth comes through challenge. As leaders, we keep growing by challenging the status quo and standing up to difficulties ourselves. We challenge others to grow by creating opportunities for them. Setting impossible goals and “seeing what happens” is not leadership, it’s gambling. Leaders are responsible for creating conditions where growth is demanding but attainable and rewarding.</p>
      <p>Leadership integrity shows up in everyday behaviour. Leaders are accountable not only for results, but for the culture they create. Giving and receiving direct, honest, and respectful feedback is essential to shaping both the environment and ourselves.</p>
