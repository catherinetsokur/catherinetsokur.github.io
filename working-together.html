    <h1>Working together</h1>
    <p>My approach is based on three principles: systems thinking, analytical problem-solving, and methodical shaping of a path forward in collaboration.</p>
    <p>I start by building a holistic understanding of what’s happening and why. By looking at the system as a whole, I focus on uncovering root causes rather than reacting to consequences.</p>
    <p>From there, I work toward clarity on what should be done. I contribute perspective and practical judgment based on my experience, and I create space for solutions to emerge through dialogue, using critical thinking and inquisitive questioning. I don’t assume I have all the answers; the goal is to arrive at a solution that will work in your specific context.</p>
    <p>Finally, we co-create a concrete path forward with actionable steps, focusing on identifying points of highest leverage. This creates alignment and commitment to making progress in the right direction.</p>
    <p>I work from the conviction that people grow most effectively by building on their strengths rather than dwelling on shortcomings. I help identify distinctive talents and strongest assets, and use them as the foundation for meaningful and sustainable growth.</p>
    <p>What I can’t do is provide motivation. Willingness to grow, improve, or change has to come from within. My role is to help turn that motivation into clarity, sound decisions, and deliberate action.</p>
