    <h1>Working together</h1>
    <p>My approach blends technical understanding, strategic thinking, problem-solving, and human psychology to help people and organisations work with purpose, clarity, and impact.</p>
    <p>I apply systems thinking to build a holistic understanding of complex problems, analyse the underlying issues, and help resolve them, either by providing practical recommendations or working together to uncover an appropriate solution. I share my knowledge and experience when it can be applicable to your situation. I focus on recognising the strengths and building on top of them, instead of investing into weaknesses.</p>
    <p>Working together, I help unblock you to take the next step.</p>
