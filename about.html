    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="default-page-section">
      <p>I create impact through leadership in technology organisations, focusing on effective execution and empowered people. I help individual contributors, managers, and leaders navigate growth and leadership challenges, and address organisational, operational, and alignment issues that slow down progress.</p>
      <p>Throughout my career, I’ve moved through different roles: from hands-on development to building and leading teams, and into strategic leadership. I’ve worked in product-technology organisations of different scales and stages, including leading teams through multiple organisational mergers. I've been accountable for delivery in environments shaped by growth, change, and competing priorities. These experiences shaped my approach to leadership, alignment, strategy and execution in practice.</p>

      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>I started my career with a background in computer science and years of hands-on engineering experience. I designed and developed robust software systems, including high-traffic and data-heavy applications, which gave me a strong foundation to lead in complex technical domains. With a solid understanding of architecture and technical trade-offs around scalability, performance, quality, and long-term maintainability, I’m able to create shared understanding and effective cross-functional collaboration.</p>
      <p>I later moved into engineering management, driven by a desire to help teams and people succeed. This experience gave me a good understanding of team dynamics and the factors that stand in the way of high performance. I worked on creating environments and processes that promote efficiency and empowerment, and developed competence frameworks and growth plans to help people realise their potential and make informed career decisions.</p>
      <p>In later roles, leading platform teams and working at the leadership level, my focus expanded to strategic alignment, execution at scale, and organisational design. I worked on setting clear engineering priorities aligned with company direction, driving complex cross-team technical initiatives, and contributing to the design of effective processes and a well-functioning organisation.</p>
      <p>Alongside my professional work, I’ve consistently invested in understanding human behaviour, leadership, and communication. Experiences such as improvisation and public speaking strengthened my leadership and communication skills and have proven valuable in both personal and professional contexts.</p>
      <p><b>Main areas of my focus:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Growing people and helping them reach their potential</li>
          <li>Developing leadership capability and high-impact communication</li>
          <li>Building effective, high-performing development teams</li>
          <li>Designing organisations and operating models that support execution at scale</li>
          <li>Creating clarity and strategic alignment around meaningful outcomes</li>
        </ul>
